### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I believe the topics discussed in my labs helped complete the assignment, but it did not fully prepare me since I had to do outside research to solve a lot of errors in my code which is a given in programming. The labs overall helped on teaching me the fundamentals to have a start on the project.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

  If I had more time, I would have changed the structure of my code so I can have each playlist card with a unique id since it would have made my code easier to create from the start. Additionally, having unique ids would allow me to delete playlist and complete the stretch milestones.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I felt what went well was learning how to shuffle the songs for any playlist since I was able to process how to code it quickly in the project. As mentioned before, I noticed how my peers used ids for each playlist and for child divs whenever they need to access information.

### Shout out
Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

Thomas Wang helped out immensely when helping me fix multiple errors that was related to javascript. He was extremely helpful and wanted to shout him out.
